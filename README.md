# Prerna_ReactJS_LabAssignment

My Project was running... screenshot added..
I have uploaded all files and folders separately.... i couldnt succeed in loading the entire folder on github ...sorry about that
My files ExpenseTracker.tsx and ShowList.tsx is in components folder.... 

I was having some issues in uploading The Sub-folder Expense-Tracker inside Client Folder  on the github;

It was my First trial with command line ...so not been able to track a solution for that in time
hoping to get excused for that this time....
